# Falcon-9-Data-Science-Project
I research how aerospace companies can reduce the cost of a rocket launch by a significant margin. 

## Project background and context
SpaceX is the only company in the world that can reuse the first stage of rocket launch. This means that they are able to save a lot on expenses needed to launch a rocket and
thus can provide rocket launches to organizations such as NASA at a much lower cost than rival companies. So, as a data scientist, we can predict if the first stage of rocket launch will land successfully using data from SpaceX past launches and thus determine the cost of a launch. This information could prove immensely useful to SpaceX rivals.

We want to find answers to the questions below:

  a. The price of each launch.
 
  b. Which Parameters determine if the first stage can be reused.
 
  c. What influences a successful rocket landing

This project is separated in 8 notebooks that span from data gathering to exploratory data analysis to using machine learning algorithms to find the answers we seek.

Find the breakdown below:

 Part 1 - Data Collection API notebook

 Part 2 - Data Collection with Web Scraping

 Part 3 - Data Wrangling

 Part 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis 1 with visualization - Pandas and Matplotlib

 Part 5 - Exploratory Data Analysis 2 with SQL

 Part 6 - Exploratory Data Visualization with Folium

 Part 7 - Interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash

 Part 8 - Machine Learning Prediction Notebook
