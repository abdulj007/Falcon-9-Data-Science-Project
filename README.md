# Falcon-9-Data-Science-Project
I research how aerospace companies can reduce the cost of a rocket launch by a significant margin. 

## Project background and context
SpaceX is the only company in the world that can reuse the first stage of rocket launch. This means that they are able to save a lot on expenses needed to launch a rocket and
thus can provide rocket launches to organizations such as NASA at a much lower cost than rival companies. So, as a data scientist, we can predict if the first stage of rocket launch will land successfully using data from SpaceX past launches and thus determine the cost of a launch. This information could prove immensely useful to SpaceX rivals.

We want to find answers to the questions below:

 a. The price of each launch.
 
 b. Which Parameters determine if the first stage can be reused.
 
 c. What influences a successful rocket landing
